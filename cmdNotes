WantFlocking = true #Also send jobs to other HTCondor Pools on campus (UW Grid)
Good for jobs that are less than ~4 hours, on average, or checkpointing jobs.
WantGlideIn = true #Also send jobs to the Open Science Grid (OSG).
Good for jobs that are less than ~2 hours, on average, or checkpointing jobs.

Universe:
1. Standard universe: The standard universe allows a job running under HTCondor to handle system calls by returning them to the machine where the job was submitted. The standard universe also provides the mechanisms necessary to take a checkpoint and migrate a partially completed job, should the machine on which the job is executing become unavailable. To use the standard universe, it is necessary to relink the program with the HTCondor library using the condor_compile command.

2. Vanilla universe: The vanilla universe provides a way to run jobs that cannot be relinked. There is no way to take a checkpoint or migrate a job executed under the vanilla universe. For access to input and output files, jobs must either use a shared file system, or use HTCondor's File Transfer mechanism.

condor_prio: modify the order in which HTCondor will run your jobs

Rank: UNDEFINED, ERROR, or a floating point value. Ordered by the floating positive value from largest and UNDEFINED & ERROR == 0.0

#list the machine that fit such constraint.

Transfer files:
1. Without a Shared File System:
1.1 should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED

1.1.1 YES: HTCondor transfers both the executable and the file defined by the input command from the machine where the job is submitted to the remote machine where the job is to be executed. The file defined by the output command as well as any files created by the execution of the job are transferred back to the machine where the job was submitted. When they are transferred and the directory location of the files is determined by the command when_to_transfer_output.

1.1.2 IF_NEEDED: HTCondor transfers files if the job is matched with and to be executed on a machine in a different FileSystemDomain than the one the submit machine belongs to, the same as if should_transfer_files = YES. If the job is matched with a machine in the local FileSystemDomain, HTCondor will not transfer files and relies on the shared file system.

1.1.3 NO: HTCondor's file transfer mechanism is disabled.

1.2 when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT

2. Shared File System:


Using R:
1. chtc_buildRlibs --rversion=sl6-R-2.10.1 --rlibs=lme4_0.999375-39.tar.gz,pedigreemm_0.2-4.tar.gz


To make file world-wide readable:
chmod a+rw path/folders that your want to make readable.
