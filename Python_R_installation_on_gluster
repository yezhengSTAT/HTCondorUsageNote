Install gcc locally:http://luiarthur.github.io/gccinstall


Install Python2.7 or newer version

./configure --prefix=locationToInstall
make
make install

For example, install on /mnt/gluster/.../Software/python
cd /mnt/gluster/.../Software/python/bin
add Python2.7 path to PATH:
PATH=$(pwd):PATH
:PATH prevents us from overwriting the old pathes

Install python library:
wget "http:.......getpip.py" (search online and get the link)
python getpip.py
pip install libraryName

To install python library ryp2, it require R_HOME:
Install R to local directory, say /mnt/gluster/...../Softwares/R

In the R installation directory:
make distclean
./configure --enable-R-shlib --prefix=/mnt/gluster/.../Softwares/R 
make
make install
cd R/bin
add R/bin to the PATH and R_HOME

Then we continue to install rpy2:
pip install rpy2
or
Download rpy2 zip file, unzip and go to that directory.
python setup.py install

Last step is to check the installation of the library.
To pass the test:
python; import rpy2.tests
Need to add the
export PATH=/mnt/gluster/.../Softwares/python/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/mnt/gluster/.../Softwares/R/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/gluster/.../Softwares/R/lib64/R/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

It is really PAINFUL to install rpy2.robjects as it requires sqlite3. Due to no root access, 
it is almost impossible to install sqlite-dev which is the most common solution online. 
Let's take python 3.6 for example:

1. get sqlite3 from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
2. tar -zxvf sqlite-3.*.*.tar.gz
3. mkdir somewhere/sqlite3
4. cd sqlite-3.*.*
5. ./configure --prefix=somewhere/python3
6. make & make install
7. in setup.py of Python-3.6.*
sqlite_inc_paths = [ '/usr/include',
                             '/somewhere/python3/include', #added
                             '/usr/include/sqlite',
                             '/usr/include/sqlite3',
                             '/usr/local/include',
                             '/usr/local/include/sqlite',
                             
If having issues with Tkinter such as No Module named '_tkinter'
7.1 download tcl and tk from http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/download.html
7.2 cd ~/Downloads/tcl8.5.11/unix
./configure --prefix=somewhere/python3
make
make install

7.3 cd ~/Downloads/tk8.5.11/unix
./configure --prefix=somewhere/python3
            --with-tcl=/home/sam/Downloads/tcl8.5.11/unix
make
make install

7.4 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=somewhere/python3/lib

7.5 cd ~/Downloads/Python3.2.3/3
./configure --prefix=somewhere/python3 
make
make install

8. in Python-3.*.*:
./configure --prefix=somewhere/python
make 
make install
9. export PATH=somewhere/python:$PATH
in somewhere/python/bin
pip3 install rpy2
pip3 install readline
10. test:
in python/bin/python
import readline
import import rpy2.robjects as ro
